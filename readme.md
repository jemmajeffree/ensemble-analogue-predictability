## Code for "Adapting analogue forecasting to compare ENSO remote influences across different models and regions"

* Core functions are contained within `predictability_tools`

* Mid-level scripts that use these functions are within the main folder, and `spinoff_EOF_configs`

* `other_examples` contains the bash higher-level scripts that call these python scripts


## If you want to calculate the influence of a region outside the equatorial Pacific on ENSO, 
using a different model or region to those presented in this paper, (i.e. make another panel for Fig 7), use the notebook `Analogues_Fig7_tutorial.ipynb`.
Code used to produce the figures in the paper is found in the notebooks under `Other examples`
